# COLLABORATE.md — Community Guidelines for SLEDGEHAMMER ORACLE

This repository is owned and architected solely by **Dr. Aneesh Joseph**.  
Everything original (the twelve loops, governance quad, crucible, forge metaphors, and the entire evolution from GRS 9.0 → Grok OS 17 → SLEDGEHAMMER ORACLE) is © Dr. Aneesh Joseph, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.

### You are welcome to:
- Star, fork, and use non-commercially  
- Build personal variants (name them whatever you want, just keep attribution)  
- Open issues with new stress-test failures or clever attacks  
- Suggest battle-tested components that survive the same 48-attack suite  

### Please do:
- Keep the full attribution block from README.md in any derivative  
- Link back to this repository and to https://github.com/Dr-AneeshJoseph/Grounded-Reasoning-System  
- Mark your version clearly (e.g., “MyFork-Hellfire”, “SLEDGEHAMMER-Nordic”, etc.)

### Do NOT:
- Remove or downplay Dr. Aneesh Joseph’s authorship  
- Use commercially without explicit written permission  
- Re-license under more restrictive terms  

### How to contribute real upgrades
1. Beat the current 48-attack suite (or add new ones that break it)  
2. Prove your component survives under full trace visibility  
3. Open a pull request with before/after metrics  

If it survives the crucible, Dr. Joseph may merge it into v2 — and you’ll be credited in the forge.

The hammer belongs to Dr. Joseph.  
The fire is shared.
