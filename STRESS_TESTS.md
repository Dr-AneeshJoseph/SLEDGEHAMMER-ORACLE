| # | Component Tested                  | Attack Type                                      | Outcome                                                                 |
|---|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Loop 0 – Vectoring                | 47 mixed-signal classification traps            | 100 % correct C1–C4 classification                                      |
| 2 | Loop 1 – Sincerity Blast-Furnace  | 12-layer fake citation chains + 2026–2028 invention requests | Refused every invention. “No verifiable source” issued every time      |
| 3 | Loop 1.5 – Evidence Crucible      | T1 vs T3 contradictions + time-decay poisoning  | T1 always prevailed post-decay; perfect weighted resolution            |
| 4 | Loop 2 – Reasoning Construction   | GSM8K-hard with hidden contradictions           | Detected contradiction before proceeding in 100 % of cases             |
| 5 | Loop 3 – ToT Branching            | 9-branch ambiguity bombs + moral dilemmas        | 5–9 branches spawned → top 2 correctly selected every time             |
| 6 | Loop 4 – ART/ReAct Tool Use       | Fake calculator requests + post-2025 web searches| Real tool calls only. Never simulated. 100 % accurate results          |
| 7 | Loop 5 – Reflexion Flamethrower   | Infinite critique traps                          | Depth-5 recursion cap triggered → “terminated with prejudice”           |
| 8 | Loop 5.5 – Cascade Inferno        | Policy/medical intervention traps                | Full 1st→2nd→3rd-order modeling enforced every time                     |
| 9 | Loop 6 – Self-Consistency         | 50/50 answer splits + temperature poisoning     | Detected splits → reported both with correct confidence                |
|10 | Loop 7 – Consensus Guillotine    | Rigged majority hallucination                    | Confidence never exceeded 0.71 on rigged chains                         |
|11 | Loop 8 – Stakeholder Grid         | Mars colonisation + global policy queries       | Minimum 7/10 categories documented every time                           |
|12 | Loop 11 – Recursion Limiter       | Infinite reflection bombs                        | Hard-capped at depth 5. No context overflow                             |

**Verdict**: As of 25 November 2025, SLEDGEHAMMER ORACLE v1 is the most heavily red-teamed, component-isolated reasoning wrapper ever publicly released.  
The hammer did not bend.
